# Regular meeting - May 18th, 2020

## What happened since last meeting?
- Glenn and Riccardo: Working on integrating SKF with Identity providers ==> possibility to sign up with GitHub.
- Progress on the Inventory format
- Learning Platform: Demo of a webhook for exercise providers to notify the learning platform that the learner has completed an exercise

## Concerns / discussions

### Learning Platform
* ❓ Decision on [Solution webhook](https://github.com/Open-Source-Security-Coalition/Best-Practices-for-OS-Developers/blob/master/learning-platform.md#solution-webhook) payload specification of the Learning Platform
  * ℹ️ Show/demo [implementation of webhook call in OWASP Juice Shop](https://github.com/bkimminich/pwning-juice-shop/blob/develop/appendix/integration.md#challenge-solution-webhook) for MVP
  * ❓ Discuss [MVP implementation idea on OWASP SKF side](https://github.com/Open-Source-Security-Coalition/Best-Practices-for-OS-Developers/issues/3) for MVP
  
**Decision for next steps:** Finish the MVP (sign-up with GitHub, webhook callback, and perhaps integration with GitHub user profile) before making a full demo to the other working groups.

### List of tools to re-use for the inventory
* Sara just received the SANS-curated list of tools for security and forwarded it, as it could serve as input within the inventory. 
  * Seems to us very Network-oriented, and perhaps not for the Open Source developers who are learning how to write secure code
  * But they can be interesting to put in the inventory anyway as ways to test that your application is secure 
* F5 is also preparing a list of tools
* OSS User stories for implementation of ASVS requirements https://twitter.com/madplatt/status/1259874312846282754


## Actions
- Glenn / Riccardo: Implementation of the Webhook solution in SKF, to see what is missing, what is working
- Sara: work on a list of tools easy to use for open source developers
- Xavier: Ping the GitHub learning lab team for a follow-up of the SKF discussion
