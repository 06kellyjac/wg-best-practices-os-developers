**Project Updates**

CII Best Practices Badge (David A. Wheeler)

* I proposed a talk at the Linux Security Summit (I’m on the program committee), but we had a HUGE number of proposals & I think it’s unlikely mine will be accepted. So if you didn’t get yours in, don’t feel bad, it was extremely competitive.
* My talk about the CII Best Practices badge *WAS* just accepted by the “Open Source Experience 2021” conference in Paris, France, Nov 9-10. This is a big OSS conference in Europe; they’re expecting 200 speakers, 70 exhibitors, and 4500 attendees &lt;https://www.opensource-experience.com/en/exhibit/why-exhibit/>.
* We now have over 600 passing projects, and are very close to having 4,000 participating projects. Stats here:  [https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/project_stats](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/project_stats)

edX Course (David A. Wheeler)

* No new news.
* Page [https://openssf.org/edx-courses/](https://openssf.org/edx-courses/) now includes direct link to GitHub page with content (for comments (file issues) and reuse by others)
* If you want changes to the edX course (for an update), please post as issues (or pull requests): [https://github.com/ossf/secure-sw-dev-fundamentals](https://github.com/ossf/secure-sw-dev-fundamentals)

SKF (Glenn ten Cate)

* Editor making good progress, with the student from GSOC
* GSOC ending in August and we plan for a release of this new feature
* Examples available in Nodejs, Python, Ruby 
* Request for help: Someone expert on Kubernetes? 
    * Currently run as 2 Kubernetes clusters
    * David W: Not an expert, but not sure that wildcards really make sense. Why not just have separate pods for everything, provides more separation & simplifies deployment. I think you’re trying to do things the hard way. IP address limitations: Consider using IPv6.

Inventory (CRE)

* No update recently

Scorecard

* No update 
* Version 2 released recently

    * Proposed cross-WG doc (will talk about next week)
    * Newly created Government Policy committee to provide feedback on OSS-impacting government things (like the recent WH EO)
        * Will be talking about DevSec best practices, vuln disclosure best practices and others
* [CRob] will be meeting with Tools WG lead to try and coordinate joint call between our groups in Aug/Sept

**WG collaboration:**

Existing Guidelines for Developing and Distributing Secure Software” - Google docs to start, once we get it going we can convert to GitHub.

DW - thinking about next steps - do we pull the best ideas out into something once dock is ready

Xav - newbie-view of “where should I start?” - edX course, start with Badge criteria/assessment, use tools ike SKF & CRE to learn new skills or show compliance with Standards

Glenn - one-pager journey to see process overview, see bottlenecks

CRob - take newbie journey + one pager and craft educational presentation
