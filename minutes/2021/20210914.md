**Project Updates**

CII Best Practices Badge (David A. Wheeler)

*  Working on implementing Scorecards and also feeding comments back
    * Implemented pinned dependencies - asked to change pinning so it only applies to applications (not automated, not clear it can do that)
    * Updated Scorecards description of CII Best Practices
    * Need to work through yes

edX Course

* Have added a number of issues for things to do for a later update. See: [https://github.com/ossf/secure-sw-dev-fundamentals/issues](https://github.com/ossf/secure-sw-dev-fundamentals/issues) - if there’s more, please add an issue!

SKF

* Making final changes to the SKF Lab Editor feature
* Testing SubDomain based deployments
* After this testing Azure deployment 

Inventory

* 

Scorecard

* Increased repo count analyzed by Scorecard to 100k.
* Recently realized [Project Thoth](https://thoth-station.ninja/) is using Scorecard - [https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/issues/978#issuecomment-917955571](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/issues/978#issuecomment-917955571).
* V2 version of result format coming. Scores of 0-10 instead of Pass/Fail.
* Design completion of Scorecard GitHub Actions and GitHub badge.

**WG collaboration:**

* “Existing Guidelines for Developing and Distributing Secure Software” - [Existing Guidelines for Developing and Distributing Secure Software](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11bRB-Q_j9sj19EEC32-ijMiEHERPRwZRVWE9HwNr2pc/edit)
* Discussion of [https://kompar.tools](https://kompar.tools) - extends CCR to record weakness coverage for various techniques. Are building these mappings for other techniques, various tools, etc.
    1. Could be really useful for Scorecard - given the tools used, what weaknesses are covered or not?
* Next project will be “newbies view” for secure coding and practices - will leverage our SKF “one-pager” as a reference to structure the deck.
    2. Suggested format - [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iyReG5FtJT5YPm5ZyFM_obWqkUGFGuRqVg5gkJ7Z3_Q/edit#slide=id.ged18471c8b_0_0](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iyReG5FtJT5YPm5ZyFM_obWqkUGFGuRqVg5gkJ7Z3_Q/edit#slide=id.ged18471c8b_0_0) 
* 2FA tokens - think OpenSSF will get a number of Yubikeys to distribute - need some hands-on video tutorials, etc., on hardware tokens so people will know how to use them well.
    3. John Naulty has past experience training on tokens
    4. Craft some training materials on how to install and use + tips & tricks (videos, etc)
    5. Need to collect use cases
        1. You just got a token!  What now? (OS differences, device differences)
        2. How to use token to log in and sign git commits: given token type, forge (GitHub, GitLab), platform
        3. How do I use it to execute a release
        4. What if it is lost or broken? Recovery mechanism / path
    6. Others interested: Chris Horn,  Ryan Ware, David A. Wheeler, Glenn ten Cate
    7. Yubikey packaging information: [YubiKey packaging - Yubico](https://www.yubico.com/support/shipping-and-buying-information/packaging/)
* NIST Workshop on Cybersecurity Labeling Programs for Consumers: Internet of Things (IoT) Devices and Software
    8. [https://www.nist.gov/news-events/events/2021/09/workshop-cybersecurity-labeling-programs-consumers-internet-things-iot](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/events/2021/09/workshop-cybersecurity-labeling-programs-consumers-internet-things-iot) 
    9. One reference cited NIST SSDF - [https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/CSWP/NIST.CSWP.04232020.pdf](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/CSWP/NIST.CSWP.04232020.pdf)
