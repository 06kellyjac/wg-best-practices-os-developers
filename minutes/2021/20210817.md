Meeting Notes:

- Very special Joint call with Tooling group NEXT TUESDAY @12pm EST - [https://meet.google.com/nid-mxeg-xwt](https://meet.google.com/nid-mxeg-xwt)
- David A. Wheeler sends his regrets, he has a conflicting meeting on 2021-08-17! He’s written notes below that report his status.

New friends:

- **Project Updates**

CII Best Practices Badge (David A. Wheeler)

- As of 2021-08-15 we have 3,997 participating projects. We expect to break 4,000 by today or tomorrow.
- Minor updates continue. E.g., we’ve updated many transitive dependencies & have improved various natural language translations

edX Course

- "You're Doing IoT RNG" presentation showed that 35 BILLION IoT devices are vulnerable due to bad random number generators:
  - Dan Petro Dan and Allan Cecil's 2021 report "You're Doing IoT RNG" at DEF CON 29 showed that Internet of Things (IoT) devices have a VERY serious problem in that they often don't securely generate random numbers.
  - This leads to vulnerabilities, since many security mechanisms depend on random numbers. They estimate 35 BILLION IoT devices have this serious flaw. That’s a lot of devices :-(.

  - Presentation: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zuqw0-jZh9Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zuqw0-jZh9Y)
- David A. Wheeler has created a proposed minor modification to the edX course to specifically point this issue out (we already noted the general problem), please comment TODAY:
  - The "Secure Software Development Fundamentals edX courses” already notes that you shouldn’t ignore error codes AND it discusses the use of cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generators.
  - Wheeler proposes that we tweak it slightly to really hit this point home, and how to do it. “I’ve draft a change to do this as this pull request”:
  - [https://github.com/ossf/secure-sw-dev-fundamentals/pull/6](https://github.com/ossf/secure-sw-dev-fundamentals/pull/6)
  - If you object or have further suggestions, please raise them by end of day. We can delay if you think we should, but tell us soon if we should!!

Scorecard

- **Proposed WG collaboration:**

David A. Wheeler proposes that the group working on developing

“Recommended GCC and clang option flags for compiling C/C++ programs”; early draft here:

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SslnJuqbFUyTFnhzkhC_Q3PPGZ1zrG89COrS6LV6pz4/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SslnJuqbFUyTFnhzkhC_Q3PPGZ1zrG89COrS6LV6pz4/edit) . Comments from him:

    Maybe someday all software will be written in memory-safe languages, but we need an approach to reduce risks from the large amount of C/C++ written & used today. GCC and clang provide a large number of option flags for compiling C/C++ programs. Many of these flags warn about potential security issues, or harden the software so that vulnerabilities are less likely or have their impacts reduced. For example, the C and C++ specifications have many undefined behaviors (UB) whose accidental use can lead to security vulnerabilities; some flags counter UBs. We can develop many of these recommendations by reviewing existing practices. This could be used by projects & distributions to select options that reduce risks.


    The intent would be to collaboratively develop an early draft using Google docs, then transition to markdown on GitHub.

Marta reports recent work on the same topic [https://forum.ostc-eu.org/t/compiler-flags-to-be-used-for-all-scenarios-os/94](https://forum.ostc-eu.org/t/compiler-flags-to-be-used-for-all-scenarios-os/94)

**One-pager**

David talked with Glann and connected about funding. Glann wonders if devoting some of that funding to the one-pager would be worthwhile.

**WG collaboration:**

“Existing Guidelines for Developing and Distributing Secure Software” - Google docs to start, once we get it going we can convert to GitHub.

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/11bRB-Q_j9sj19EEC32-ijMiEHERPRwZRVWE9HwNr2pc/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11bRB-Q_j9sj19EEC32-ijMiEHERPRwZRVWE9HwNr2pc/edit)

- Will talk with the Tooling group on 8/24.
- Will review Tooling feedback as a group 8/31
- Target 9/14 for publication of guidance
- Next project will be “newbies view” for secure coding and practices - will leverage our SKF “one-pager” as a reference to structure the deck.
