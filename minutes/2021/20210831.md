New friends:

- **Project Updates**

CII Best Practices Badge (David A. Wheeler)

- We now have over 4,000 participating projects (4029 as of August 30), see [https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/project_stats](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/project_stats)
- As always, update dependencies. This included updating Rails 6.1.3.2->6.1.4.1, which addressed actionpack vulnerability CVE-2021-22942, &lt;[https://groups.google.com/g/rubyonrails-security/c/wB5tRn7h36c](https://groups.google.com/g/rubyonrails-security/c/wB5tRn7h36c)> "Possible Open Redirect in Host Authorization Middleware".
- We point to the edX course, but edX’s text makes it appear you must pay to take the lessons. We now point to the OpenSSF page, clarified that you “audit” to take the free course, and make the same changes on the OpenSSF website page about the course. That should make it easier for people to understand the difference between paid & free, and then easier to choose their preferred option.

edX Course

- No new news.

SKF

- Finalizing gsoc implementation of editor (fixing window resizing)
- Will next modify SKF to launch editor
- Adding KB descriptions & guidance on implementation for MASVS (Mobile application security verification standard) + expert system
- Working on CII Best Practices Badging process - Glenn may create a blog post. It wasn’t bad, learned some things (e.g., didn’t have a way to report vulnerabilities). Needed to have license in GitHub, etc. Could have boilerplate best practices template
- Best Practice Badge “starter kit” of templates to jumpstart new projects with examples for them to leverage
  - David: I’ve talked with others before. One challenge is that it’s more work than it appears at first. Maybe with very simple text instructions to start with, and then later try to automate some things.

Scorecard

-

C/C++ recommendations for compiler flags

- Marta has a similar thing
- In general, it’s agreed to be a good idea.
- Start on Google docs, then transition to GitHub doc Markdown within the Best Practices WG - [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SslnJuqbFUyTFnhzkhC_Q3PPGZ1zrG89COrS6LV6pz4/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SslnJuqbFUyTFnhzkhC_Q3PPGZ1zrG89COrS6LV6pz4/edit)

**WG collaboration:**

1. “Existing Guidelines for Developing and Distributing Secure Software” - [Existing Guidelines for Developing and Distributing Secure Software](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11bRB-Q_j9sj19EEC32-ijMiEHERPRwZRVWE9HwNr2pc/edit)
   1. Will talk with the Tooling group on 8/24. - check - they will be reviewing their existing docs
   2. Will review Tooling feedback as a group 8/31 - - Tools not prepared at this time
   3. Target 9/14 for publication of guidance - **_Q to group - do we publish without Tooling Group input or do we wait?_**
2. Next project will be “newbies view” for secure coding and practices - will leverage our SKF “one-pager” as a reference to structure the deck. 5. Suggested format - [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iyReG5FtJT5YPm5ZyFM_obWqkUGFGuRqVg5gkJ7Z3_Q/edit#slide=id.ged18471c8b_0_0](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iyReG5FtJT5YPm5ZyFM_obWqkUGFGuRqVg5gkJ7Z3_Q/edit#slide=id.ged18471c8b_0_0)
