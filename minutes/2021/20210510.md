**Project Updates**

edX Course

- 3,189 registrants total,
- Growth continues
- We didn’t really push on the contributions, we are just looking for getting the word out atm
- The conversion to markdown is finished
  - [https://github.com/ossf/secure-sw-dev-fundamentals](https://github.com/ossf/secure-sw-dev-fundamentals)
  - Best way to suggest is with issues on this repo

SKF

- Finalization of the screens and flow for the Code review labs
  - Meeting to investigate the use of GitHub advisory DB to create content for these labs more automatically than now
- Approached by OWASP CodeReview Guide to integrate their code review labs into SKF
  - [https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP_Code_Review_Guide_v2.pdf](https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/OWASP_Code_Review_Guide_v2.pdf)
- Google Summer of Code : Potential to get a slot there and have a student developer working on the “editor lab”: Start with a vulnerable code, step by step instructions to detect the vulns, how to exploit it, then instructions to mitigate the vuln: you can modify the code, fix it, verify it.
  - Potentially use CodeQL in the verification phase
- Integration of the CRE project into SKF
- Budget: Request sent, waiting for feedback
- Visual Studio Code plugin that gets requirements from SKF API.
  - → Annotations that you will get in your code: what category are you working on?
  - From a tool (name) ???
  - Visual representation of your code and where potential security problems can be
  - Bringing your threat modeling exercise in your IDE
  - 80% done, Demo is coming

CII Best Practices Badge

- Update various libraries routinely: puma (web server), chartkick (graphics display), bullet, minitest-try, codecov (we didn’t have the bash pipe-to-curl vulnerability), etc.
- Minor improvement to programmatic project data update script
- Key: Rails had a security update, we updated to production &lt; 1 hour after security announcement
- Estimate operating costs of $4.5K/year (mainly Heroku costs), have made a formal request to OpenSSF to fund operations once OpenSSF starts getting funding

Inventory

- Progressing with mapping and python lib to parse these mappings
- Integration with SKF
- Gap analysis: in CRE, select 2 standards and check how they fit, how they map ...

Scorecard (Update from Azeem)

- New design starting: Scaling to more repo numbers
- Indications on what you can do to improve your scorecard
- Bi-weekly coordinations to handle contributions

Diagram: No update

Marketing site to attract developers and guide:

- We have a starting point with the edX courses
- We don’t have anything beyond that
- Idea: create a pipeline, from awareness to expertise - visual representation of that pipeline and link to the different projects
- [https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-integration-standards/blob/master/writeups/owasp_in_sdlc/index.md](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-integration-standards/blob/master/writeups/owasp_in_sdlc/index.md)
- Glenn and Spyros start some exploratory work on that pipeline

Jonathan L working on CodeQL for Java:

- Wants to get more people to use CodeQL
- Target top open source java projects and activate CodeQL on them with the native GitHub actions
