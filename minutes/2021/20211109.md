Meeting Notes:

* @CROB reach out to GitLab contacts to get re-engagement
* New Friends?
* Opens
* Town Hall Next week!
* SECOM “Adoption”/endorsement
    * [https://tqrg.github.io/sec-commits/](https://tqrg.github.io/sec-commits/) 
* Great MFA Giveaway collab
    * [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hhg4KcLCzEdd9ZcbdEviN0TIUTLyWDsIdF6B_hY3Xv0/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hhg4KcLCzEdd9ZcbdEviN0TIUTLyWDsIdF6B_hY3Xv0/edit)
    * Giveaway - Google will give Titan keys - give coupon codes, order on Google.
    * CRob volunteers to help with Yubikeys
    * GitHub - verbal commit - talk with Xavier - can give 500 Yubikeysk, coupon tokens to order them on GitHub shop.
    * Can’t give to places forbidden by export controls
    * Plan to work on “most critical projects” - as identified by project Alpha, Harvard analysis, criticality score
    * Perhaps we could use them as reward for improving Scorecard or CII BP badge score (secondarily)
    * “Don’t want this to be a token effort” (GB)
    * Xavier: We want this to go even bigger. If the first phase works well,  we can provide more. It’s super-important to align on success measures.
    * Need to measure “this person wasn’t using MFA & now they are & they are a contributor to an OSS project”
        * Maybe ask contributors to give us GitHub / GitLab handles - GitHub & GitLab can then check before/after (didn’t have 2FA before, had 2FA after)
        * OpenSSF could track coupon codes & accounts
        * GitHub could make queries before & after on accounts and report % of accounts that use 2FA at end & percentage that used at start of those users
        * Need to develop a draft proposal for measuring results, e.g., capturing account names, & run by legal
    * Laurent: This information is available within GitHub if they use GitHub, but not public
    * There’s a debate on whether or not to publicly show “this user uses MFA” via API
    * What are Alpha/Omega timelines (when do we need to be ready?)

New friends:

* Arlen Baker (Wind River)

We have a new OpenSSF Governing Board (GB), lots of additional money allocated.

CII Best Practices Badge (David A. Wheeler)

* Presented today at Open Source Experience, Paris, went well
* Rename: “CII Best Practices Badge” to “OpenSSF Best Practices Badge” (GitHub badge would show “ossf passing” et al.? [https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/issues/1515](https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/issues/1515)
    * Generally agree, eliminates confusion
    * What about scorecard? “OpenSSF ScoreCard Badge” if it has a badge
* We’re getting a HUGE number of queries of the form GET path="/projects.json?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fpoppinss%2Fmodule-methods-extractor" host=bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org fwd="34.72.136.33, 34.72.136.33,167.82.161.45" - they _appear_ to be from Google IP ranges (not a single system). They aren’t taking us down but they sure create log entries. Anyone know what’s going on?
    * Azeem Shaikh - analyzing a million repos a week.

edX Course (David A. Wheeler)

* No new news.

SKF (Glenn)

* 

Inventory

* 

Scorecard (Laurent)

* Working on a tighter collaboration with AllStar.
* Scorecard GitHub Actions should be rolling out soon. Thanks to Laurent!
* Exploring Scorecard + SLSA collaboration. azeems@ will present some high-level ideas in the coming weeks at this meeting if anything materializes here.
* Pinning & Dependabot discussion:
    * Dependabot doesn’t look for malicious components before notifying an update currently. Have separate work to look for that.
    * (Long discussion)
    * Wheeler: Think GitHub would be willing to tweak the matching comment (“COMMENT-SYMBOL pin NUMBER”) ?:
    *       # the naming convention of https://github.com/mheap/pin-github-action
    * -      - uses: actions/checkout@1e204e9a9253d643386038d443f96446fa156a97 # pin @v2.3.4
    * +      - uses: actions/checkout@1e204e9a9253d643386038d443f96446fa156a97 # pin @v2.3.5 

**Future WG collaboration:**

* “Existing Guidelines for Developing and Distributing Secure Software” - [Existing Guidelines for Developing and Distributing Secure Software](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11bRB-Q_j9sj19EEC32-ijMiEHERPRwZRVWE9HwNr2pc/edit)
* Next project will be “newbies view” for secure coding and practices - will leverage our SKF “one-pager” as a reference to structure the deck.
