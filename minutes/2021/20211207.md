Great MFA Distribution Project

- This is VERY time-sensitive, so request that we complete this agenda item FIRST & then others as needed.
- Purpose of Great MFA Distribution Project is to send _FREE_ hardware MFA tokens (generously provided by Google & GitHub, 500 each) to critical OSS projects. This helps counter some attacks, e.g., attackers using stolen passwords of legitimate developers to distribute subverted source code and/or packages
- More info at [https://github.com/ossf/great-mfa-project](https://github.com/ossf/great-mfa-project) (some details at [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hhg4KcLCzEdd9ZcbdEviN0TIUTLyWDsIdF6B_hY3Xv0/edit#heading=h.1sasnsizzrv0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hhg4KcLCzEdd9ZcbdEviN0TIUTLyWDsIdF6B_hY3Xv0/edit#heading=h.1sasnsizzrv0) )
- Which projects to distribute to? OpenSSF critical projects WG has developed a list of ~100 critical OSS projects here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ONZ4qeMq8xmeCHX03lIgIYE4MEXVfVL6oj05lbuXTDM/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ONZ4qeMq8xmeCHX03lIgIYE4MEXVfVL6oj05lbuXTDM/edit#gid=0) ; this is the set of projects we’ll offer MFA tokens to
- Overall process:
  - We notify critical OSS projects that they’re eligible for free MFA tokens, they tell us if they want them (& how many of each).
  - We distribute “coupon codes” (Google Titan) and “validation codes” (GitHub Yubikeys) to the projects. Each is a use-once code that lets people “buy” the token at no charge from the Google Store / GitHub Shop (respectively).
  - Note: OpenSSF _never_ has physical possession of the tokens, nor do we have to ship them - the stores handle this.
- CRITICAL ISSUE: MUST distribute Google tokens by the end of December, as their coupon codes expire then. We might get more later, but we LOSE any we don’t distribute this time around.
- David A. Wheeler has done a “trial run” with the Linux kernel & curl
  - Linux kernel doesn’t need any (they have their own supply), but Greg K-H did provide some helpful feedback
  - curl is interested, they’d like at least 4 (still working details).
- We NEED NOTIFIERS. NOW.
  - Notifiers contact projects, share our invitation &lt;[https://github.com/ossf/great-mfa-project/blob/main/invitation.txt](https://github.com/ossf/great-mfa-project/blob/main/invitation.txt)>, report back if they want tokens, how many, & where to send the info.
  - Ideally a notifier is already known to the project - not always possible, but please tell us of those who know you, so we can prefer you!
  - If we have 5 notifiers, that means each notifier will have to notify 100/5 = 20 projects, so more notifiers are better.
- VOLUNTEER NOTIFIERS ARE:
  - David A. Wheeler - dwheeler@linuxfoundation.org
  - Xavier Rene-Corail
  - Marta Rybczynska
  - CRob
  - John Naulty - john.naulty@coinbase.com
  - Arnaud J Le Hors
  - Glenn ten Cate
  - Georg Kunz
- Notifiers: Please let us know which projects know you
  - Editable copy of crit project list, put your notifier name in column H, [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sO_tJ_B7_2I-TUx23pnBoIRJIqaOm8yBnKAwqs7DwBw/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sO_tJ_B7_2I-TUx23pnBoIRJIqaOm8yBnKAwqs7DwBw/edit#gid=0)
  - By end of TODAY, put your name in column H of any project who knows you. After that, we’ll assign the rest.
  - Tomorrow+, please start sending invitations. Text of invitations: [https://github.com/ossf/great-mfa-project/blob/main/invitation.txt](https://github.com/ossf/great-mfa-project/blob/main/invitation.txt) (e.g., email) [https://github.com/ossf/great-mfa-project/blob/main/invitation.md](https://github.com/ossf/great-mfa-project/blob/main/invitation.md) (e.g,. GitHub issues)
- We also need help improving our “how to” documents on how to use them - EVERYONE, please keep creating pull requests to improve them!!
- Next round Marta suggests adding bootloaders to list
  - David A. Wheeler: Good idea! Please mention this to Amir
  - David A. Wheeler has added a stub to the critical OSS projects WG’s list, so that they will at least consider this.

CII Best Practices Badge (David A. Wheeler)

- Discussing rename from “CII”. I’ve been busy on Great MFA Distribution, but intend to get back to that & complete it.

edX Course (David A. Wheeler)

- No new news.

SKF(Glenn)

- Next project will be “newbies view” for secure coding and practices - will leverage our SKF “one-pager” as a reference to structure the deck.

- Can be used for project omega
- GCC flags for C/C++:
- Q: What’s the connection to SLSA?
- Yotam suggests the “MITRE-attack framework” to look at/refer to

**Future WG collaboration:**

- “Existing Guidelines for Developing and Distributing Secure Software” - [Existing Guidelines for Developing and Distributing Secure Software](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11bRB-Q_j9sj19EEC32-ijMiEHERPRwZRVWE9HwNr2pc/edit)
