* Varun - demo of [https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner](https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner) 
    * Analyzes GitHub actions while running, proposes improvements
    * Demonstrated against GitHub varunsh-coder/supply-chain-goat which has known weaknesses
    * Could eventually add other systems like CircleCI
    * There’s some similar work specific to containerd, but not everyone uses containerd
    * David A. Wheeler volunteered to try out harden-runner on the OpenSSF Best Practices Badge project. PR: [https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/pull/1786](https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/pull/1786)

    * Xavier: Happy to share the previous work from the GitHub Security Lab
    * David: I’ll introduce Xavier & Stephen to each other via email (done)
