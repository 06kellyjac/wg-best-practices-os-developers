OpenSSF Best Practices Badge (David A. Wheeler)

* No big changes here

    Fundamentals Course - on edX & LF Training (David A. Wheeler)

* Various minor improvements
        * Expansion on integer overflow/underflow
* About to post on the second platform (LF Training) - certifications of completions free - soft launch
        * Should happen this week (March 30)
        * Will allow cert completion for FREEEEE
        * edX will still be a going concern, this platform is an addition not a replacement
        * When materials are updated, will need to make sure it gets updated in both places (alas)
            * Inefficient process, but LF training recommends it because other processes they’ve tried don’t work in practice.

SKF(Glenn)

* Demo of the Learning Platform
* Will be a third platform for the Fundamentals course!
* Planning soft release this Friday
* Walkthrough of the course
* Includes labs for each topic (or will; not all topics have it yet) 
* Labs have OS, terminal, etc.
* Have lots of quizzes - they translated that by hand
* [https://demo.securityknowledgeframework.org](https://demo.securityknowledgeframework.org)
* Marta: Shouldn’t there be one place for the fundamentals course?
        * David: There is, it’s GitHub. All edits go there & they’re tracked. Unfortunately the hand-translations, while not my preference, seem to be necessary.
        * Glenn: Maybe something for the future.
    * Why one file?
        * Easier to move things around in one file, computers have plenty of memory & storage now. I (David) put it in one file intentionally, but if it’s important to break it up into multiple files, please explain why…

    Inventory (spyros)

* No big changes

Scorecard (Laurent - Azeem)

* 

**Opens**

* Feedback SKF Learning platform Demo
* Bigger question: Marketing. How do we make sure people know about things like the new fundamentals platform, big update for SKF Learning platform, etc.? Comm plan?
    * VM: We (best practices WG) should have a rep on the marketing committee
    * CRob: We should be more purposeful on marketing
    * Jory: We definitely want to improve internal communication
* Next time, let’s discuss “infinity” diagram as potential Landing page for WG
    * [https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/tree/main/infinity2](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/tree/main/infinity2) 
    * Email from David: 
    * I really like the flashy *look* of the "infinity" diagram at wg-best-practices-os-developers/infinity2/index.html It's cool!!
    * However, I don't like most of its current *categories*. I think they should be replaced, depending on what we want to do.
    * At least some of these should replaced with the processes identified in ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 (software processes), which are also the same processes identified in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 (system processes). At least make them as easy to map as practical. These are the de jure standard terms & are widely used in a variety of industries. The standard is paywalled, but categories are listed here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_12207
    * We also want to reuse the SLSA diagram where we can, which talks about source (development), build, & package. See: https://slsa.dev/
    * So here are the current infinity categories:
      * Training
      * Code Repo
      * Continuous Integration
      * Continuous Development
      * Production Machine
      * Design / Requirements
    * They're a mix of infrastructure components, processes, concepts, ....! I don't think Continuous Integration & Continuous Development should be separate. "Design / Requirements" is odd; usually you want to know what a system should do before you design it :-).
    * So how about these categories instead as a starting point:
      * Training
      * Requirements & Design
      * Implementation
      * Build & Verification
      * Distribution
      * Deployment & Operation
      * Infrastructure [for Code Repo, etc.]

**Future WG collaboration:**

* “Existing Guidelines for Developing and Distributing Secure Software” - [Existing Guidelines for Developing and Distributing Secure Software](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11bRB-Q_j9sj19EEC32-ijMiEHERPRwZRVWE9HwNr2pc/edit)
* Next project will be “newbies view” for secure coding and practices - will leverage our SKF “one-pager” as a reference to structure the deck.
