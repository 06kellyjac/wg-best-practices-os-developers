**Project Updates**
**(please enter and speak to anything interesting)**

OpenSSF Best Practices Badge (David A. Wheeler)

* Someone added 12 fraudulent badge entries (claims were clearly false, but they did just enough to evade the automation). The badge entries have been deleted & the user account suspended.
* There was a vulnerability in a dependency (actionpack/puma), we’ve updated. It took longer than expected because a password change caused a key rotation (we didn’t realize it would do that); we had to track that down.

edX Course (David A. Wheeler)

* 

SKF(Glenn)

* 

Inventory (spyros)

* Have started writing parsers (some owasp projects) to auto- add sections of standards and other projects mostly from OWASP, if there’s community members who would like to see their project or standard in opencre.org please reach out.

Scorecard (Laurent - Azeem)

* 

**Opens**

* Spyros - does anyone have any experience parsing “Open Threat Model Definition” - none in meeting did.
* Note this related link: [https://github.com/hysnsec/awesome-threat-modelling](https://github.com/hysnsec/awesome-threat-modelling)
* Converting Google docs -> markdown can be a problem. For the edX course we used: [http://github.com/mangini/gdocs2md](http://github.com/mangini/gdocs2md). An alternative is [https://github.com/lmmx/gdocs2md-html](https://github.com/lmmx/gdocs2md-html). Neither seems to be well-maintained, but they help. Pandoc does it & is maintained, but David A. Wheeler found pandoc wasn’t very good at it. If someone knows of a better alternative, esp. OSS, please let us know!

**Future WG collaboration:**

* “Existing Guidelines for Developing and Distributing Secure Software”  
    1. [Existing Guidelines for Developing and Distributing Secure Software](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11bRB-Q_j9sj19EEC32-ijMiEHERPRwZRVWE9HwNr2pc/edit) -google doc - no longer being edited
    2. [https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/blob/main/docs/Existing%20Guidelines%20for%20Developing%20and%20Distributing%20Secure%20Software.md](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/blob/main/docs/Existing%20Guidelines%20for%20Developing%20and%20Distributing%20Secure%20Software.md) - git - make edits here please
    3. Add COBOL, Angular, C#, Docker, ML, CWE bad coding practices
    4. Let’s add machine learning. For discussion see: [https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/51](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/51)
* Next project will be “newbies view” for secure coding and practices - will leverage our SKF “one-pager” as a reference to structure the deck.
