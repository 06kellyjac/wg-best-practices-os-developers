Meeting Notes:

- Welcome new friends
  - Josh M (Red Hat) - Security Architect, Product Security
  - Christine Abernathy (F5) - leads OSPO
  - Harimohan Rajamohanan (Wipro) - Solution Architect in OSPO
  - Jack Kelly (Control Plane)
- Is someone willing to scribe for the meeting?
- Call for opens (list new items below)
- WG [charter](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/blob/main/CHARTER.md)review, [debate](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/issues/57), & approval
  - TSC section might go away as we do not have a TSC, and no plan to create one
  - There might be a conflict for tools like SKF where there is already a charter in OWASP
  - Aeva: We (TAC) need a scope and a primary point of contact.
  - Get the scope statement from the readme / after review, or from the slack channel description
    - Slack: “The Best Practices for OSS Developers working group is dedicated to raising awareness and education of secure code best practices for open source developers. This WG is chaired by @Christopher Robinson and @Xavier René-Corail”
    - WG Home page has a scope statement: [https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers)
    - README includes this not in Slack: “The Developer Best Practices group wants to help identify and curate an accessible inventory of best practices”
    - DavidW created this merger: The Best Practices for OSS Developers working group is dedicated to help identify and curate an accessible inventory of best practices; raising awareness; and education of secure code best practices for open source developers.
- OpenSSF [Day](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-north-america/features/openssf-day/) (CRob)
  - Foundation has been able to get some extra space to create an OpenSSF Day / track on, Austin TX & virtually
  - Jory: I’m working to find out what the virtual experience will be like, don’t know yet, will try to get more info by TAC meeting
  - CRob / Xavier not currently sure if will be there virtual or physical
  - Link currently only allows virtual
  - Jory will try to track the link issue down
- David W: Proposed new work item,”Quick Guide for Developing Secure Software”
  - Goal: Create a ONE PAGE guide to how to develop secure software, including supply chain integrity during build & deployment
  - Basic approach: one place to start, provides links to other works for the details. It’d have links to badge, training, scorecards, SLSA, etc.
  - CRob: I had proposed this earlier, so I agree
  - “How to evaluate OSS before including” would be a separate 1-page document (should we create that at the same time too)
  - Final version could be put on OpenSSF website or elsewhere to help people get started
  - Draft here for developer guide: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/16jUqTEFG-wscZUGR-NGa_3a81GF3YILtH9XgOSkLCTM/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16jUqTEFG-wscZUGR-NGa_3a81GF3YILtH9XgOSkLCTM/edit)
  - Draft for evaluation (less mature currently): [https://docs.google.com/document/d/19015o63pA-sZPBN5-R7I7Cg8ICPxo6fXH8vOI1RgBYM/edit#](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19015o63pA-sZPBN5-R7I7Cg8ICPxo6fXH8vOI1RgBYM/edit#)
  - Laurent: overlap with the best practices list for Alpha / Omega?
    - Don’t think it has to be superseded, but the A/O one was intended specifically for them. If they happen to be the same thing, then let’s merge, but they don’t absolutely need to be the same thing.
    - Should definitely cross-compare
  - CNCF doc has a document too, but focused on cloud-native development tools
    - [https://project.linuxfoundation.org/hubfs/CNCF_SSCP_v1.pdf](https://project.linuxfoundation.org/hubfs/CNCF_SSCP_v1.pdf)
    - Wheeler: The draft 1-pager includes a link to that
  - Jeff B: Maybe after we create a 1-pager, it’d be useful to create a “middle ground” too between 1-page & deep dive
  - Any oppose? No one opposed
  - CRob will send the TAC an email ~Thursday to TAC saying that best practices WG plans to add this a
- David W: Topic for discussion: OpenChain security guide.
  - OpenChain is a widely used international standard for ingest of OSS. Originally focused on licensing. OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230 – Security Assurance Reference Guide - OpenChain
  - They’ve created a “security guide” addendum. Original guide: August 2021: [https://www.openchainproject.org/security-guide](https://www.openchainproject.org/security-guide)
  - Draft version 2.0 On GitHub here: [https://github.com/OpenChain-Project/SecurityAssuranceGuide/tree/main/Guide/2.0](https://github.com/OpenChain-Project/SecurityAssuranceGuide/tree/main/Guide/2.0)
  - They’d like feedback.
- Jeff M: Process for Package Manager Best Practices guide: proposal, review, publishing
  - [https://github.com/ossf/package-manager-best-practices/blob/main/process.md](https://github.com/ossf/package-manager-best-practices/blob/main/process.md)
  - This is being started here in the best practices WG, might move to the package management/repo working group later presuming that is formed, but let’s work on this until that is decided.
  - Once it’s mature, the 1-pager would link to it

      OpenSSF Best Practices Badge (David A. Wheeler)

-

edX Course (David A. Wheeler)

- Working to add 2021 CWE Top 25, and maybe 2021 OWASP Top 10 for web apps, in time for the **April 17** deadline for (edX) updates. If you want to see other changes, please propose them (e.g., as merge requests). This is causing the addition of some new material, in particular to cover:
  _30: CWE-917, Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an Expression Language Statement ('Expression Language Injection')
  _ 31: CWE-59, Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')
  _32: CWE-401, Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime
  _ 34: CWE-427, Uncontrolled Search Path Element
  _35: CWE-319, Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
  _ 36: CWE-843, Access of Resource Using Incompatible Type ('Type Confusion')
  _(These are weaknesses that, according to the CWE Top 25, have become more common and thus are worth discussing.)
