Omega

- [laurent & Jeff] looking for folks interested in taking some items in (request access)
  - Omega is a low-touch for the “long tail” in Alpha-Omega
  - Want to develop “materials that scale” - can just hand to developers
  - E.g., combine scorecards, badge, package manager guides, etc., to give a “top 10 of the first things to do to improve your security” E.g., “here are things you can flip on” vs. other things.
  - Need to add badges
  - Current list is GitHub-specific, many projects aren’t on GitHub
  - Pinning dependencies - good on apps, terrible for libraries.
  - Could this be a general template that could be modified & sent to specific projects?
    - There’s no way they’ll modify it for each of 10K+ projects, it needs to be general
  - Script to verify would be helpful

Inventory

-

Scorecard

- [Laurent & Azeem] scorecard v4 launched, see [ossf blog](https://openssf.org/blog/2022/01/19/reducing-security-risks-in-open-source-software-at-scale-scorecards-launches-v4/)

**Future WG collaboration:**

- “Existing Guidelines for Developing and Distributing Secure Software” - [Existing Guidelines for Developing and Distributing Secure Software](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11bRB-Q_j9sj19EEC32-ijMiEHERPRwZRVWE9HwNr2pc/edit)
- Next project will be “newbies view” for secure coding and practices - will leverage our SKF “one-pager” as a reference to structure the deck.
