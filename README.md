# Best Practices for Open Source Developers

Anyone is welcome to join our open discussions related to the group's mission and charter.

## Objective

Our objective is to provide open source developers with best practices recommendations, and with an easy way to learn and apply them.

Unlike other existing best practices list, we want it to be widely distributed to open source developers and community-sourced. And we want these practices to stick, thanks to an effective learning platform.

## Vision

Our vision is to make it easy for developers to adopt these best practices, thanks to:
- [An accessible inventory of best practices](docs/inventory.md)
  - Prioritized according to ROI for open source developers
  - Categorized per technology, language, framework
  - Community-curated
- A community
  - Program to attract open source contributors and incentivize them to
    use and contribute to the inventory
- [A Learning platform](docs/learning-platform.md)
  - Any free course can be integrated into the platform
  - The learner can follow a track, track their progress and get badges
  - A suite of exercises are available for each best practice of the
    inventory
