# Best Practices for Open Source Developers

Anyone is welcome to join our open discussions related to the group's mission and charter.

## Objective

Our objective is to provide open source developers with best practices recommendations, and with an easy way to learn and apply them.

Unlike other existing best practices list, we want it to be widely distributed to open source developers and community-sourced. And we want these practices to stick, thanks to an effective learning platform.

## Vision

Our vision is to make it easy for developers to adopt these best practices, thanks to:
- *Identifying* good practices, requirements, and tools that help open source developers create and maintain more secure software
- Helping maintainers *Learn* to write secure software
- Provide tools to help developers *Adopt* these good practices into their daily work
    
   ## Scope
The Developer Best Practices group wants to help identfy and curate an accessible [inventory](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/blob/main/docs/inventory.md) of best practices
  - Prioritized according to ROI for open source developers
  - Categorized per technology, language, framework
  - Community-curated

Help build a community
  - Program to attract open source contributors and incentivize them to use and contribute to the inventory

Supply a Learning platform
  -Any free course can be integrated into the platform
  - The learner can follow a track, track their progress and get badges
  - A suite of exercises are available for each best practice of the inventory


   ## Prior Work
Our work is organized into several discrete-yet-related projects that help us achieve our goals:
- *Common Requirement Enumeration (CRE) Project* - https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-integration-standards  
  - Purpose - (Identify) Identify similar requirements in different specifications
- *Secure Software Development Fundamentals* (edX course) - https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/linuxfoundationx-secure-software-development-fundamentals 
  - Purpose - (Learn) Teach software developers fundamentals of developing secure software
- *SKF - Security Knowledge Framework* - https://www.securityknowledgeframework.org/ 
  - Purpose - (Identify/Adopt/Learn) Learn to integrate security by design in your web application
- *CII Best Practices Badges* -https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/  
  - Purpose  - (Identify/Adopt) Identifies FLOSS best practices & implements a badging system for those practices,
- *Scorecards Project* - https://github.com/ossf/scorecard
