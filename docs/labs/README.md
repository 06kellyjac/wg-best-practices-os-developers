# Labs

These are labs for those who are learning how to develop secure software.
See our [introduction](introduction) for more information.

Here are the labs available:

* [input1](input1.html)
* [input2](input2.html).

See [create labs](create_labs) if you want to learn how to create labs.
In particular, that page will link to how to
[create labs using checker](create_checker).

To submit new or updated labs, create a pull request on the
[OpenSSF Best Practices WG](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/)
