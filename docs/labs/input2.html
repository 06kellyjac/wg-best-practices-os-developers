<h1>Lab Exercise Input2</h1>
<p>
This is a lab exercise on developing secure software.
For more information, see the <a href="introduction.html">introduction to
the labs</a>.

<p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
In this exercise, we'll add some simple input validation to
a server-side program written in JavaScript using the
Express framework (version 4) and the express-validator library.
</p>

<p>
However, this time we're going to do input validation for a specific
data value using regular expressions. Many programs have 
specialized data values that are easily tested using
regular expressions.

<p>
The code below sets up handlers for a <tt>get</tt> request on path
<tt>/invoices</tt>.
This code could be triggered, for example, by requesting
<tt>http://localhost:3000/part?id=AX-794-7</tt>
(if it was running at <tt>localhost</tt> and responding to port 3000).
If there are no validation errors, the code is supposed to show the part id.
If there is a validation error, it responds with HTTP
error code 422 ("Unprocessable Content"), a status code suggesting
that the request was invalid for some reason, along with an error message.

<p>
In this case, we want to implement proper input validation.
We want to ensure it's not longer than a certain length and
that it matches a specific pattern.
Just like lab input1, as written,
this program has a vulnerability we haven't discussed yet called
Cross-site Scripting (XSS).
This particular vulnerability would be entirely prevented if we did
better input validation.

<p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>
Please change the code below so the query parameter
<tt>id</tt> <i>must</i> be no longer than 80 characters
and meets this application's part id format requirement.
In this application, a part id is always
two uppercase Latin letters (each <tt>A</tt> through <tt>Z</tt>),
then a dash (<tt>-</tt>), a sequence of one or more digits,
another dash (<tt>-</tt>), and another sequence of one or more digits.

<p>
To do that,
after the first parameter to <tt>app.get</tt>
which says <tt>'/parts'</tt>,
add a new comma-separated parameter.
Start this new parameter with
<tt>query('id')</tt> to select the
<tt>id</tt> parameter for validation (we've have <i>not</i> filled
in this part in this lab).
Add a period (<tt>.</tt>) and the validation requirement
<tt>isLength()</tt>
The <tt>isLength</tt> method takes, as an optional parameter inside
its parentheses,
an object providing specific information such as a minimum and a maximum.
We only want a maximum,
so it should look something like
<tt>isLength({max: YOUR_MAXIMUM})</tt>.
Those familiar with JavaScript will know that the "length" value is
the length of the string in UTF-16 code units; that's fine
for our purposes.
</p>

<p>
We also need to verify that the input matches our pattern,
which we can verify using a regular expression.
In this situation, we can do this by appending another
period (<tt>.</tt>) and the validation requirement
<tt>matches()</tt>.
Inside those parenthesis you should supply slash (<tt>/</tt>, the
text of the regular expression to match, and another slash (<tt>/</tt>).
In JavaScript, a pair of slashes (<tt>/</tt>) surrounds a regular expression.
Remember to match the <i>entire</i> expression
(in other words, use <tt>^</tt> and <tt>$</tt>).
Remember, a way to match a single uppercase character is the
pattern <tt>[A-Z]</tt> ... good luck!

<h2>Interactive Lab (<span id="grade"></span>)</h2>
<p>
<!--
You can use this an example for new labs.
For multi-line inputs, instead of <input id="attempt" type="text" ...>, use
<textarea id="attempt" rows="2" cols="70">...</textarea>
-->
<form id="lab">
<pre>
// Set up Express framework and express-validator library
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const { query, matchedData, validationResult } = require('express-validator');

// Implement requests such as http://localhost:3000/parts?id=1
app.get('/parts',
<input id="attempt0" type="text" size="70" value="  ,"> 
  (req, res) =&gt; { // Execute this code if /invoices seen
    const result = validationResult(req); // Retrieve errors
    if (result.isEmpty()) { // No errors
      const data = matchedData(req); // Retrieve matching data
      return res.send(`You requested part id ${data.id}!`);
    }
    res.status(422).send(`Invalid input`);
  })
