# Compiler Hardening Guides

This is the working area for the C/C++ Compiler hardening best practices guide.  This document is currently work-in-progress and in incubation state.

## Scope and Objectives

This document is a guide for compiler and linker options that contribute to delivering reliable and secure code using native (or cross) toolchains for C and C++.
The objective of compiler options hardening is to produce application binaries (executables) with security mechanisms against potential attacks and/or misbehavior.

## How to Contribute

Contributions to the guide are always welcome, for instance:

* documentation of additional, currently not yet covered, compiler options which improve the security of binaries,
* documentation of similar/equivalent options of other (widely used) compilers which are currently not yet covered by this guide,
* improvements of the existing text

The group of authors meets online every other week to discuss open items and work on the doucment.
The [meeting details](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/tree/main#meeting-times) can be found in the main [README](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/blob/main/README.md) of the Best Practices Working Group.

Pull requests as always welcome!
