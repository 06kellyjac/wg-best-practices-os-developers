Existing Guidelines for Developing and Distributing Secure Software

A product of the OpenSSF Best Practices Working Group

This document is a summary of various guidelines for developing and distributing secure software. Many summaries are quoted abstracts from the materials themselves. They are listed as “[marker] organization/author, name of document: description” so that this can be easily reused as a bibliography. We only list the current version of each document. Items are sorted to make them easier to find.

Note that many materials are focused on specific situations that may not apply to others. For example, some guidance materials are focused on developing software within large organizations, and in many cases on developing proprietary software; such materials can be challenging to apply to smaller projects and/or open source software projects. Similarly, materials for web applications may not always apply to other kinds of software.
